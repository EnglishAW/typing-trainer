# typing-trainer
This is a simple typing trainer I built in [Preact](https://preactjs.com) using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) to help with styling.

This is the first functioning release which allows you to type one default prompt and gives you visual feedback on if you missed a character or not. 

### Planned future features:
- Ability to add custom text
- Ability to report a score
- Ability to track performance on a per character basis
- Ability to to select certain characters to work on and create prompts based on character composition of words in the english language.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by one of my favorite typing trainers on the web at [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) so make sure to check them out!
